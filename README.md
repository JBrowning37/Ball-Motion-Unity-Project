# Ball-Motion-Unity-Project

This was one of the final assignments from the C# and Unity Course from The Tech Academy. It was made to showcase what I had learned from all the coding challenges showcased in the C# and Unity Projects repository. 

This is a quick game in which you must roll a ball through the obstacles to get to the end of the course.
